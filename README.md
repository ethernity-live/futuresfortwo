Financial futures for two

First participant chooses to vote for a rate of any criptocurrency to increase or decrease over time, and chooses the odds.

Second participant can bet against him/her, a minimum amount according to the odds sat by the first one.


Both participants can raise their bets every time they want. If the other participant does not reach the minimum, the excedent will be returned to the first one, no matter if he wins or loses the bet

Bets will be closed 15 minutes before the evaluation date.

Once the time is reached, the current rate will be read and compared to the rate at the beginning.

The winner will get the total matched bets, minus the fee. If there are an excedent, it will be returned to the one who bet it.
